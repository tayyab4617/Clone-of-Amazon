# Clone-of-Amazon
This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon homepage designed using pure HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and visual structure of the original site, including the navigation bar, product categories, promotional banners, and product listings. The clone focuses on responsiveness, clean UI design, and structured code.
